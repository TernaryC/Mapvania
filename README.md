# Mapvania
 Mapvania is a tool for creating room-and-hall based maps.
 
 The tool was created for use by game developers, as an assistant to designing maps for metroidvanias or other similarly-structured games. 
 
 Mapvania was made using Processing.py
 
###### Note: Due to a bug in how Processing.py exports, the source code is included with every release.
